# Linear Programming (LP)

> Also known as *linear optmization*, is a method to achieve the best outcome, e.g. maximum profit or lowest cost, in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. 

Given a transformation between input and output values, described by a mathematical function f, optimization deals with generating and selecting the best solution from some set of available alternatives. This is performed by systematically choosing input values from an allowed set, computing the output of the function and then recording the best output values found during the process. 

* It's a special case of mathematical programming, a.k.a mathematical optimization.

Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in a canonical form as:


Maximize    $$c^{T}x$$
subject to  Ax$\leq$b
and         x$\geq$0
