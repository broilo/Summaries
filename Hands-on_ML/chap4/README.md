# Linear Regression

> More generally, a linear model makes a prediction by simply computing wieghted sumof the input features, plus a constant called the *bias term* (also called the *intercept term*).

```
yh = a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... + an*xn
```
* yh is the predicted value
* n is the number of features
* xi is the i-th feature value
* aj is the j-th model parameter (including the bias term a0 and the feature weights a1,a2,...,an)
