# What is Machine Learning?

> *"Machine Learning is a thing labeler. Is an approach to making lots of small 
decisions with data"* [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1AiQwxkX7A)

> Differently from traditional programming, in ML is the programmer's task to 
feeding examples into the system and it's the ML algorithm's job to stitch the 
recipe together out of the examples.
 
> Example: A spam filter based on ML techniques automatically learns which words 
and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually frequent patterns 
of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples.

> Machine Learning can help humans learn!



 ### Key-words: 
 * Training set: Is the example that the system uses to learn.
 * Training instance (or sample): Is the training example.
 * Data mining: Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data which 
 helps to discovering patterns that were not immediately apparent.
