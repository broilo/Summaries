# Working with Real Data

Here are a few places to look for data set:

* Popular open data repositories:
    * [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
    * [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
    * [Amazon’s AWS datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
* Meta portals (they list open data repositories): 
    * http://dataportals.org/
    * http://opendatamonitor.eu/
    * http://quandl.com/
* Other pages listing many popular open data repositories: 
    * [Wikipedia’s list of Machine Learning datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)
    * [Quora.com question](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-large-datasets-open-to-the-public)

# Look at the Big Picture

This chapter will use the [California Housing Prices data set from the StatLib repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/).

## Frame the Problem

> First question: What's exactly the business objective and how does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?

* To build a model probably isn't the end goal.
* This first question will determine:
    * how to frame the problem.
    * what algorithm to select.
    * what performance measure can be used to evaluate the model.
    * how much effort should be spent tweaking it.

> Second question: What the current solution (if any) looks like?

* It will often give you: 
    * reference performance
    * insights on how to solve the problem

## Select Performance Measure
